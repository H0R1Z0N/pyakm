# pyakm (or Arch Linux Kernel Manager 0.0.2)

Simple kernel manager for arch linux basically a gtk application to manage official kernels.

Binaries include:
* pyakm-system-daemon
* pyakm-manager

pyakm-system-daemon will be started by systemd upon the execution pyakm-manager. That means you can see the logs via `journalctl -u pyakm-system -b 0 | grep pyakm > log.txt` or something similar. Send me the logs this way. This software comes with a dbus service which you can use an interface for your scripts etc.

There are not many decent pyalpm, python-dbus, polkit examples around. So, I hope this will also be useful if you are searching for an answer on these topics.

GUI can be simplified to four tasks:
- Remove         : Removes selected kernel and updates grub. 
- Set as Default : Adds an entry to your grub menu for the selected kernel and updates grub.
  - If you want to remove this entry simply delete `/etc/grub.d/01_pyakm` and update grub.
- Select         : Installs kernel with selected version. Adds the kernel and the header package to `IgnorePkg` in `/etc/pacman.conf`
- Upgrade        : Installs the latest version of the selected kernel. Removes the kernel from `IgnorePkg`

For some reason, if gui stuck or frozen. You probably need to restart the `pyakm-system` service via `sudo systemctl restart pyakm-system`. And send me the logs of course.

As is, this software is enough for my purposes so I will probably fix some bugs as I go along and leave it there. If you would like to see more features, let me know.
